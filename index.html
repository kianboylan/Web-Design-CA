			<h3 style="color:white"> A little about us</h3>
			</center><p style="color:white"> Hello and welcome to our brand new business, Pawsome Grooming! We're more than just a clever name, we provide some of the best pet grooming services to date. we make sure our staff love your pets just as much as you do, as this proves you can have the peace of mind knowing they will receive the optimal care. We are a local business established in 2020(I know, such a bad time to start a business)but with following the government's guidelines for COVID-19, we will have nothing to worry about!

			<h3 style="color:white">I have received phone calls to collect my dog as they act out, will your establishment be the same?</h3>
			<p style="color:white">No. For example, you bring your dog to the groomers for their scheduled appointment and leave to await their collection time, just before you start your car to run errands, you receive a phone call to say your pet is misbehaving and hindering their opportunity to be groomed so you must collect them. Here at Pawsome Grooming, if your pet is nervous and acts out, rest assured you have nothing to worry about as we also made sure to employ the most patient animal lovers! Should a pet be aggressive, we have the correct equipment to deal with such cases that will ensure the safety of our staff with causing minimal distress to the pet.</p></center>

		<h3 style="color:white"> Services we provide</h3>
		<p style="color:white"> We begin with washing your furry friend as this makes shaving their fur much easier! We then shave them to the way you desire and then once the shaving is complete, we wash them one more time to get any stray hairs that may stick around after. We dry them off and cut their nails if requested and finally, spray them with pet perfume to make sure they're smelling their best!</p>
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<h3 style="color:white">COVID-19 Update</h3><p style="color:white">Following our government's guidelines, we must ask you to put on a mask and sanitise your hands when entering our centre to ensure safety for you and our staff. We also ask for only 2 people at a time to wait at our reception and to queue outside should there be more people. We usually offer the an opportunity to sit in the room where your pet is being groomed but for now, please drop your pet off and we will contact you when your pet is ready to be collected. Should you refuse to follow these said guidelines, we will unfortunately have to refuse your entry and your ability to avail of our services. Thank you for co-operating during these trying times and hope everything will get back to normal soon. Take care!</p>
